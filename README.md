# Clean and Cut

**Background Remover App** is a web application built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** that allows users to remove the background from images with a single click. It leverages the [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) API to handle background removal and provides an intuitive, modern UI for users to upload images and download the processed output.

## Key Features:
- **Image Upload**: Upload any image from your device.
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Convenient drag-and-drop interface for image uploads.
- **Real-time Background Removal**: Remove the background of images using the remove.bg API.
- **Download Output**: Download the background-removed image directly in your preferred format.
- **Smooth Animations**: Added background animations for a modern, interactive user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all devices.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite.js
- **API**: [remove.bg API](https://www.remove.bg/)

## How it works:
1. Upload an image from your device or drag and drop it into the upload area.
2. The app processes the image through the remove.bg API, which handles the background removal.
3. Once the process is complete, you can preview and download the image with the background removed.

### How to Add the `README.md` to Your Repository:

1. If you're creating or modifying the `README.md` locally:
   - After editing the file, add and commit the changes to your repository:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add project description"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. If you're using GitHub's online editor:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the `README.md` file (or create a new file with that name if it doesn't exist).
   - Paste your description, commit the changes, and it will be saved directly in the repository.

Once the `README.md` is in place, visitors will see it as the main documentation when they land on your repository's main page.
